Step 1
	Cut an 18-inch diameter circle out of the wood board.
	This will be the main playing surface of your game board.

Step 2
	Draw a straight line down the center of the circle with a pencil. 
	Use a light line, as you do not want it to persist after sanding.
	
Step 3
	Draw 17 lines on the wood perpendicular to the line from Step 2, with one 
	line every inch, starting 1 inch from one end of the bisecting line from Step 2. 
	Due to the shape of the circle, these lines will not be all the same length. 
	You should end with the 17th line 1 inch from the other end of the bisecting line.
	
Step 4
	Draw a small X on the point where the first line from 
	Step 3 intersects the bisecting line from Step 2.
	
Step 5
	Draw a pair of X's on the second line from Step 3, 
	with one on either side of the line from Step 2. 
	Each X should be 1/2 inch from the line from Step 2, 
	making them an inch apart.
	
Step 6
	Continue marking the rows with the following number of X's on each 
	line: 3, 4, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
	Each row marked should be centered along the line from Step 2, 
	with an inch between each X, meaning rows with an odd number of 
	X's will feature an X on the line and an equal number on either 
	side of the line, while rows with an even number will have an 
	equal number on either side, but no X on the line.
	You should end up with a shape matching the image in the references.
	
Step 7
	Drill a hole through each of the X's marked on the wood. 
	These holes will make the pockets for the marbles to rest in.
	
Step 8
	Sand all sides of the wood board.
	
Step 9
	Stain the board and leave to dry.

Step 10
	Place each set of 10 marbles in one of the points of the star, 
	in the top four rows of the point.
